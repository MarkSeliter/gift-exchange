My final project for cs50x (not submitting)

## Details
Im creating this projects as my final project for the cs50x course, however I'm not going to submit because I'm not trying to get the cert.
this is going to be a web app which is meant to manage a game I wanted to play with my friends during lockdown.
the point of the game is to send a secret gift to a friend which doesnt know who's the gifter.
when the game ends (everyone got their gift) the players can reveal what they got and later reveal who are the senders.

This is the first project ever that Im doing not on the cs50 IDE (which is a virtual lab provided by the cs50 staff).
This means that Im for the first time utulizing my own machine for a projects (installing my own libraries, using my own code editor and debugger and so on)

## What I practice during this project
Python
JavaScript
Sqlite
Jinja2 (using Flask)
Linux (using wsl2)

## this was cs50
